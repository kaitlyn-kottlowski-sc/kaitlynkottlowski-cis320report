Annotated Bibliography
======================

The State of JavaScript 2020 site [#f1]_ displays data about front-end frameworks. I found that Angular was in the Top 3
of Satisfaction and Interest from 2016-2017, but drastically decreased from 2018 to now. However, the usage through the
last 5 years has stayed in the #2 spot, while also doubling its percentage from 2017-2018. The overview of opinions on
Angular is 50/50 between would not use/not interested vs would use again/interested. I can use this data to help look for
other resources that will explain the increase or decrease of data in a given year.

A site called Developers posted an article about Angular vs. React [#f2]_. Angular 1 did not start out well; it wasn't until
final release of Angular 2 that the framework got a positive use. Angular 4 is now seen as a "promise of relative stability."
The Angular framework "comes with data-binding bundled in" versus React's unidirectional approach.

The eBook written by Prashant Padmanabhan [#f3]_ is a guide to building single-page applications with Angular and Java EE.
The book will cover Angular fundamentals and how you can connect the frontend Angular application with Java. I will learn
how to add and manage features using Angular, as well.

The Omega Science International Center of Innvoation Research [#f4]_ answers four questions about angular. What is Angular?
How does Angular work? Is it updated often? When should you use Angular? The paper also goes on to list out pros and cons,
as well as "quick facts and tips." I can pull more factual information about Angular and its origins from this paper.

The NG Conference had Rachel Noccioli [#f5]_ talks about how to use the Angular Material UI library to build applications
more easily. She walks through a few demos to show examples of what UI features Angular Material can display. Noccioli
also explains some of the built-in functions on the API. I will be able to pull information about how to produce less
complicated UI features using an Angular library.
